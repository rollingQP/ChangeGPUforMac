# SwitchGPUforMac
A bash script that can switch GPU types on Mac

----

## Introduction
The main idea of the script is using `sudo pmset -a GPUSwitch` to switch GPU of your Mac.

It's only been tested on MacBook Pro (16 inchesï¼Œ2019).

There are four ways to use the program.

### Shell Script

You can just run `./chgpu.sh` or configure the environment variables for it.

Don't forget to run `chmod +x chgpu.sh` before if you have not.

### Python Script

You can run `python3 chgpu.py` if you have installed Python 3. Note that Python 2 is not supported.

### Binary file

You can download and run the binary file `chgpu`. In general, you can double-click it to run it. It may take a while to load.

### GUI binary file

You can download and double click to run the binary file `chgpuGUI`. It's very intuitive, so I don't think you need a tutorial.
